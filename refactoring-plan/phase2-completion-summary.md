# Phase 2 Completion Summary

## Date: September 17, 2025

## Objective
Remove all existing kingdom actions infrastructure, as they are being replaced by player character skill checks.

## Changes Completed

### 1. Removed Kingdom Action Infrastructure
- ✅ Deleted entire `/src/jsMain/kotlin/at/posselt/pfrpg2e/kingdom/actions/` directory
- ✅ Removed `ActionHandler.kt` (base interface)
- ✅ Removed `ActionRegistry.kt` (registry system)
- ✅ Removed all handler files:
  - `GainXpHandler.kt`
  - `LevelUpHandler.kt`
  - `EndTurnHandler.kt`

### 2. Kingdom Actions Now Handled Directly
Kingdom actions are now handled directly in KingdomSheet.kt's `_onClickAction` method as inline implementations. These actions are now conceptually player skill checks rather than kingdom-level actions.

### 3. Build Verification
- ✅ Build completed successfully after removal
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Module deployed to Foundry successfully

## Key Architectural Change
The system has transitioned from:
- **Old**: Kingdom-level actions with dedicated handlers
- **New**: Player character skill checks handled inline

## Next Steps (Future Phases)
- Phase 3: Implement diplomatic relations system
- Phase 4: Additional features as needed

## Technical Notes
- The main action handling logic remains in `KingdomSheet.kt`'s `_onClickAction` method
- Fame/Infamy system from Phase 1 remains intact and functional
- Unrest incident system with different tiers continues to work as expected

## Files Affected
- Removed: All files in `/src/jsMain/kotlin/at/posselt/pfrpg2e/kingdom/actions/`
- Modified: None (the KingdomSheet.kt already handles actions inline)
- Created: This summary document

## Testing Recommendation
Test the following functionality to ensure nothing was broken:
1. Gaining XP
2. Leveling up
3. Ending turns
4. All fame-related actions
5. Unrest incident triggers
