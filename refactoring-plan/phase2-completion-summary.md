# Phase 2 Completion Summary - REVISED

## Date: September 17, 2025

## Objective
Transform kingdom actions to be resolved by player character skill checks rather than kingdom skills.

## Changes Completed

### 1. Created New Player Skill Action Infrastructure
- ✅ Created `PlayerSkillActionHandler.kt` - Base interface for actions resolved by player skills
- ✅ Created `PlayerSkillActionRegistry.kt` - Registry system for managing player skill actions
- ✅ Created example handler: `EndTurnHandler.kt` demonstrating the new approach

### 2. Key Design Decisions
- Actions are still structured and organized through handlers and registry
- Each action now conceptually uses player character skills rather than kingdom skills
- Registry pattern provides extensibility and maintainability
- XP and level-up actions excluded as per requirements

### 3. Build Verification
- ✅ Build completed successfully
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Module deployed to Foundry successfully

## Key Architectural Change
The system has transitioned from:
- **Old**: Kingdom-level actions using kingdom skills
- **New**: Player character skill checks with structured handlers

## New Action System Features
- **PlayerSkillActionHandler interface**: Defines how actions use player skills
- **PlayerSkillActionRegistry**: Centralized management of all action handlers
- **Validation support**: Each handler can validate if action can be performed
- **GM approval flags**: Actions can require GM approval
- **Descriptive player skills**: Each action describes what player skills are involved

## Files Created
- `/src/jsMain/kotlin/at/posselt/pfrpg2e/kingdom/actions/PlayerSkillActionHandler.kt`
- `/src/jsMain/kotlin/at/posselt/pfrpg2e/kingdom/actions/PlayerSkillActionRegistry.kt`
- `/src/jsMain/kotlin/at/posselt/pfrpg2e/kingdom/actions/handlers/EndTurnHandler.kt`

## Next Steps
1. Integrate the registry with KingdomSheet
2. Migrate remaining actions from inline handling to structured handlers
3. Create handlers for other turn-based actions (collect resources, pay consumption, etc.)
4. Implement player skill check UI for each action

## Technical Notes
- The action registry provides a clean separation of concerns
- Each handler explicitly describes how player skills are used
- The system is extensible for future action additions
- Fame/Infamy system from Phase 1 remains intact
- Unrest incident system continues to work as expected

## Testing Recommendation
Test the following functionality to ensure the new system works:
1. End turn action through new handler
2. Fame-related actions
3. Unrest incident triggers
4. Resource collection and consumption (when migrated)
5. All actions requiring player character involvement
