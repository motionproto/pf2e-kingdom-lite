   - Incident checking and rolling
   - Resolution handling

2. **Incident Tables** ✅
   - 27 unique incidents across 3 tiers
   - Complete percentile tables
   - CHARACTER skill checks (not kingdom skills)

3. **Data Structures** ✅
   - UnrestTier enum with penalties
   - PassiveUnrestSources calculation
   - IncidentResolutionResult handling

4. **Integration** ✅
   - EndTurnHandler integration

## Phase 4: Major Game Events System 🔄 NEXT

### Planning:
Create a comprehensive random events system for kingdom management

### Key Components to Implement:

#### 1. RandomEventsManager
- Event checking during turn processing
- Event rolling based on conditions
- Resolution handling
- History tracking

#### 2. Event Tables
**Categories**:
- Beneficial Events (25% chance)
- Harmful Events (25% chance)  
- Dangerous Events (30% chance)
- Continuous Events (special handling)

**Sample Events**:
- Beneficial: Bountiful Harvest, Trade Boom, Diplomatic Gift
- Harmful: Crop Failure, Bandit Activity, Noble Feud
- Dangerous: Monster Attack, Natural Disaster, Plague
- Continuous: Building Demand, Squatters, Cult Activity

#### 3. Event Resolution System
- Skill check options for event resolution
- Multiple resolution paths
- Consequences and rewards
- Continuous event tracking

#### 4. Integration Points
- EndTurnHandler for event checks
- Settlement modifiers affecting event chances
- Kingdom level scaling
- Event history persistence

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Create Core Manager**
   ```kotlin
   class RandomEventsManager(game: Game) {
       fun checkForEvent(kingdom: KingdomData): KingdomEvent?
       fun resolveEvent(event: KingdomEvent, choice: EventChoice)
       fun getContinuousEvents(): List<ContinuousEvent>
   }
   ```

2. **Define Event Data Structures**
   ```kotlin
   data class KingdomEvent(
       id: String,
       name: String,
       category: EventCategory,
       description: String,
       choices: List<EventChoice>,
       isContinuous: Boolean
   )
   ```

3. **Implement Event Tables**
   - Port events from reference material
   - Balance percentile ranges
   - Add skill check DCs

4. **Create Resolution Handlers**
   - Process player choices
   - Apply consequences
   - Track continuous effects

5. **Add Testing**
   - Unit tests for manager
   - Event table validation
   - Resolution testing

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Random events trigger based on percentile rolls
- [ ] Events have multiple resolution options
- [ ] Continuous events persist across turns
- [ ] Settlement modifiers affect event chances
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage

## Phase 5: Simplified Resource System

### Planning:
Streamline resource management for better UX

### Goals:
- Reduce complexity of resource tracking
- Automate common calculations
- Improve resource visibility
- Simplify trade and commerce

### Key Changes:
1. **Unified Resource Pool**
   - Combine similar resources
   - Automatic conversion rates
   - Simplified display

2. **Automated Production**
   - Calculate production per turn
   - Handle consumption automatically
   - Clear surplus/deficit indicators

3. **Trade Improvements**
   - Simplified trade routes
   - Automatic trade calculations
   - Better trade UI
