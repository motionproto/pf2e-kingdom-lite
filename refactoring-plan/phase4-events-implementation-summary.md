# Phase 4: Kingdom Events Implementation Summary

## Status: COMPLETED WITH EXTENDED SELECTORS

### System Extended with New Selectors
The ModifierSelector enum has been extended to support GOLD and FOOD resources, enabling more accurate event implementations that match the Reignmaker-lite specifications.

### Valid ModifierSelectors in System
```kotlin
enum class ModifierSelector {
    CHECK,        // For skill check modifiers
    ORE,          // Ore resource modifier
    STONE,        // Stone resource modifier  
    LUMBER,       // Lumber resource modifier
    CONSUMPTION,  // Consumption modifier
    GOLD,         // Gold/treasure rewards (NEW)
    FOOD          // Food resource modifier (NEW)
}
```

### Updated System Integration
1. **ModifierSelector.kt**: Added GOLD and FOOD enum values
2. **CalculateIncome.kt**: Added handling for gold and food modifiers in resource collection
3. **Events**: Updated to use proper gold and food selectors

### Completed Events

1. **archaeological-find.json** - Beneficial event
   - Uses society skill
   - Rewards gold (2 on critical success, 1 on success)
   - Represents discovered treasures and artifacts
   
2. **assassination-attempt.json** - Dangerous event
   - Uses intrigue skill
   - Increases consumption on failure (representing disorder)
   - Wounded effect uses CHECK selector (-2 to checks)
   
3. **bandit-activity.json** - Continuous dangerous event
   - Uses warfare skill
   - Can steal gold and food resources
   - Critical success: Recover gold from defeated bandits
   - Continuous trait for multi-turn persistence
   
4. **food-surplus.json** - Beneficial event
   - Uses agriculture skill
   - Grants food resources directly (3 on critical success, 2 on success, 1 on failure)
   - Represents agricultural bounty

### Event Structure
```json
{
  "id": "event-id",
  "name": "events.eventId.name",
  "traits": ["beneficial|dangerous|continuous"],
  "modifier": 0,
  "stages": [{
    "skills": ["skill1"],
    "criticalSuccess": {
      "msg": "translation.key",
      "modifiers": [{
        "type": "untyped",
        "selector": "ore|stone|lumber|consumption|check|gold|food",
        "value": 1,
        "enabled": true,
        "turns": 1
      }]
    }
  }]
}
```

### Implementation Features
✅ Extended ModifierSelector enum with GOLD and FOOD
✅ Updated CalculateIncome.kt to process new selectors
✅ Events now accurately represent Reignmaker-lite concepts
✅ Removed all "leader" fields from stages
✅ All modifiers properly structured with turns for temporary effects
✅ Compatible with existing modifier evaluation system

### Integration Points
- Events loaded from `data/events/*.json`
- EndTurnHandler processes events and ticks modifiers
- New selectors integrate with existing modifier system
- Translation keys: `events.[eventId].[path]`
- Resource collection properly handles gold and food modifiers
